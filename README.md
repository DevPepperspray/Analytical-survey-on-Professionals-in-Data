I used a raw dataset from https://lnkd.in/ed4qrwap which is a survey taken by different data professionals.
I imported the data into Excel, cleaning and formatting it to make visualization easy.

I then imported it to Power Bi and first transformed the data before finally going into visualization and the creation of a dashboard.

From the dashboard, we can see;
The number of professionals that took the survey.
The average age of the data professionals involved in the survey.
The average income of each data professional and their various job titles.
The most used programming language.
How difficult management is in their professions.
How satisfied they are with their pay.
The average salary of Males against Females in various professions

And last the Region of each survey taker as a filter.
